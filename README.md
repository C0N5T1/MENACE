# MENACE
 Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine in Python

 I learned about the MENACE tictactoe engine last semester and wanted to implement this idea in python.
 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchbox_Educable_Noughts_and_Crosses_Engine)

I was able to implement a function that also updates any equivalent states in the q-table to make the learning process faster by eliminating the need to learn about every state of the board even if it is only a rotation/mirroring of an already known state.

Please excuse any major mistakes I made I'm just trying to get some results even if the way is not at all optimal.
