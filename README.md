 Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine in Python

 I learned about the MENACE tictactoe engine last semester and wanted to implement this idea in python.
 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchbox_Educable_Noughts_and_Crosses_Engine)

It's not very good right now mainly because every state of the ttt-board is viewed seperately and the engine has to learn about states that are equivalent multiple times.
BUT the engine is learning (even though it's quite slow)

Please excuse any major mistakes I made I'm just trying to get some results even if the way is not at all optimal.
